			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is 'single-family' like in reality? Are single-family zones
					homes for large families with children or small, older households?
					<p style="margin-left: 1em;">
						<em>Motivation:</em> In <em>Exclusionary by Design</em>, the author
						brings up the questions on "whether single-family-only zoning represents
						good and just policy overall" and how they lack flexibility to accommodate
						the changing need of residents. This had me thinking what the current
						single-family homes look like. Increasingly, single-families are small.
						On average, people are having less children than before, which makes what
						a single-family looks like now much different from before. What are the
						families like now that are living in the single-family-only zones vs.
						other zones?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Does single-family zoning create racially and economically segregated communities?</li>
					<p style="margin-left: 1em;">
						<em>Motivation:</em> The <em>Illegal City of Somerville</em> highlights how zoning 
						codes can make it effectively illegal to build the kind of dense, walkable neighborhoods 
						that already exist and that many people want to live in. 
						In addition, <em>Exclusionary by Design</em> traces how Greater Boston's zoning history 
						has been shaped by both class elitism and racial exclusion, arguing that single-family 
						requirements and large-lot mandates have restricted access to opportunity-rich neighborhoods 
						by pricing out lower-income households, who are disproportionately people of color. 
						Does our data show this pattern in Metro Boston? How bad is it? 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Does single-family zoning allocate land efficiently, or does it
					concentrate population into a fraction of available space?</li>
					<p style="margin-left: 1em;">
						<em>Motivation: </em> Living in Cambridge, I've always felt the contrast
						between the spacious single-family neighborhoods in surrounding suburbs
						and the dense, packed apartment areas closer to the city. It always made me
						wonder whether this is just a natural urban-to-suburban thing or
						something actively created by zoning: are single-family zones deliberately
						reserving more land than their population needs, while everyone else
						competes for whatever's left?

				<b>Mapping of Zoning Districts Across Metro Boston</b>
				<br/>
				This interactive map colors each zone by whether it allows only
				single-family housing (light blue) or other housing types (dark blue),
				with hovered text showing the municipality name, zone type, percentage of
				land zoned single-family, and population. The map reveals that each
				municipality can contain 1-2 zones with different zoning types,
				suggesting the dataset stores one row per zone rather than one row per
				municipality. The map also exposes significant geographic gaps: large
				portions of Metro Boston, including parts of Boston itself, have no
				coverage, possibly limiting the generalizability of findings. Also, when hovering
				over zones, a land vs. people imbalance shows: in Brookline,
				roughly 70% of residential land is zoned single-family yet houses only
				about 220 (scaled) people, while the remaining 30% absorbs nearly 600 (also scaled), 
				suggesting that single-family zoning may reserve disproportionate land for
				relatively few residents.

				<b>Population and Households Counts by Municipalities</b>
				<br/>
				To investigate the population scale shown by the map, this chart plots
				the population (blue) and household count (red) from the 2010 Census for
				each municipality, sorted by population. The ranking reveals some significant
				irregularities: Salem reports the highest population in the dataset
				(exceeding Boston), while dense urban communities like Somerville,
				Chelsea, and Everett report zero despite having tens of thousands
				of residents in reality, and even mid-range towns like Cambridge appear
				extremely small compared to Franklin, which ranks third. These cannot be explained
				by the geographic gaps alone and suggest that the population values in this dataset 
				may have been scaled or collected to zoning boundaries in ways that distort municipality-level
				totals, meaning raw population counts should not be taken at face value during analysis.
				However, the household counts do track consistently with population
				(higher population towns have more households), suggesting the relative
				structure of the data may still be useful even if absolute magnitudes
				are unreliable.

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/age_gender.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					<b>Population Distribution by Gender and Age Group</b>
				<br/>
				Given the population irregularities identified in the previous chart,
				one possible explanation is that the total population field was
				incorrectly logged while the underlying demographic subgroups (gender
				and age) were recorded accurately, which would mean we could reconstruct
				a "true" total by summing the subgroups. To test this, the chart breaks
				population down by gender (blue = male, red = female) and age group
				(under 18, 18-64, 65+). However, the subgroup counts sum exactly to the
				reported total population for every municipality, ruling out a simple
				logging error in the total: the subgroups themselves carry the same
				scaling or allocation issues. This means that while raw counts are
				unreliable for comparing municipality sizes, proportions (like 
				"% under 18" or "% female") should still be valid for demographic
				analysis since the relative proportions within each municipality are consistent. 
				Not shown here, but further analysis confirmed that proportional
				demographic patterns across municipalities also do not correlate with
				single-family zoning rates, reinforcing that the more reliable
				analytical approach might be comparing between zone types within
				municipalities.

					<b>Zone Classification Consistency Check Across Municipalities</b>
				<br/>
				Each dot represents one of the municipalities, colored by zone
				classification: red for only single-family, blue for only other housing,
				and purple for towns with both zone types. The categorical and continuous
				fields are consistent: red dots sit at exactly 100%, blue at
				exactly 0%, and purple spans the range between. However, several
				"Has Both" towns (circled) are effectively single-zone municipalities:
				Sherborn (99.87%), Sudbury (99.78%), and Weston (99.21%) are mostly SF zoned, 
				while Essex (0.15%) and Stow (0.03%) have almost no SF zoning. Due to these edge cases, within-town
				comparisons between SF and Other zones are unreliable since the smaller
				zone contains too few residents for stable demographic percentages.

				<figcaption>
					<b>Family Size Distribution: SF Zones vs. Other Zones</b>
				<br/>
				Given the data quality issues with municipality-level comparisons
				identified earlier, this visualization shifts to comparing across zone types,
				aggregating all SF zones together and all Other zones together across the
				region. This butterfly chart shows the distribution of family sizes
				(2-person through 7+) as a percentage of family households in each zone
				type, with SF zones extending right and Other zones extending left. The
				distributions are nearly identical: 2-person families dominate both zone
				types at roughly 41%, and the average family size is 3.15 persons in SF
				zones versus 3.14 in Other zone: a difference of essentially zero. This
				plot challenges the image of "single-family" zoning: if the policy exists to
				protect large families, the data shows these zones do not actually house
				larger families than other parts of the region.

					<b>Demographic Comparison Across Zone Types: Age, Household Structure</b>
				<br/>
				To test whether SF zones differ from Other zones on any demographic
				dimension, these four panels compare zone-level percentages where each
				dot represents one zone across Metro Boston. The age panels (% under 18
				and % age 65+) show nearly complete overlap between SF and Other zones: SF zones are
				not meaningfully younger or older. The household structure panels show a
				slightly larger gap: SF zones average 77.3% family households compared
				to 72.5% in Other zones, with a corresponding difference in
				single-person households. Even on the dimension where single-family
				zoning should create the clearest separation, household type, the
				distributions overlap substantially, reinforcing the analysis from the
				family size chart that SF zones do not house a distinctly different
				population from the rest of the region.

				<img src="figures/race.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					<b>Racial Composition: Single-Family Zones vs. Other Housing Zones</b>
				<br/>
				While earlier analysis found no meaningful difference in household structure between
				zone types, this chart tests whether the people living in those zones
				differ racially. The left panel compares four major racial groups across
				SF and Other zones: SF zones are 88.7% white compared to 84.6% in Other
				zones, with every nonwhite group (Black (2.1% vs 3.2%), Asian (5.2% vs
				6.6%), and Latino (2.1% vs 3.4%)) underrepresented in SF zones. The
				right panel summarizes this as a white-versus-nonwhite split, showing
				that Other zones are more likely to have nonwhite residents
				(15.4% vs 11.3%). The differences are modest in absolute terms but
				consistent in direction across every racial group, suggesting that
				single-family zoning is associated with whiter communities even when
				household structure looks identical.

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/income.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					<b>Income Distribution: Single-Family Zones vs. Other Housing Zones</b>
				<br/>
				Extending the analysis from race to income, this chart compares the
				income distribution of households in SF zones versus Other zones using
				2014-2018 income data. Notably, the household counts in the 2014-2018 income dataset differ
				substantially from the 2010 Census counts used earlier with a Spearman
				correlation of only 0.39 between the two, so this analysis uses the
				2014-2018 income dataset's own household totals as denominators rather than mixing sources.
				<br />
				<br />
				The left panel shows that SF zones have a higher share of households
				earning $150K+ (15.1% vs 11.7%) and $200K+ (24.8% vs 21.1%), while
				Other zones have a higher share of lower-income households across both
				the under $25K and $25-50K brackets. The right panel distills this into
				a clear summary: nearly 40% of SF zone households earn $150K+ compared
				to about 33% in Other zones, while Other zones have 25.1% of households
				earning under $50K compared to only 20.3% in SF zones, suggesting that
				single-family zoning concentrates wealth in SF zones while lower-income
				households are filtered into other housing zones.

				<img src="figures/grid_sf.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					<b>The Cramming Effect: Land Allocation vs. Population Distribution</b>
				<br/>
				Shifting from who lives in single-family zones to how much space they
				occupy, this chart compares two shares across municipalities with
				single-family zoning across the entire Metro Boston: each square represents 1% of the total. The left
				grid shows that 74% of residential land is zoned for single-family
				housing, while the right grid shows that only 53% of the population
				actually lives in those zones: a 21% gap. The visual
				contrast between the two grids makes the imbalance obvious as
				single-family zoning reserves nearly three-quarters of residential land
				for roughly half the population, while the remaining quarter of land
				must absorb everyone else. This suggests that single-family zoning may
				be an inefficient use of residential land, dedicating disproportionate
				space to housing types that does not serve the majority of residents.

				<img src="figures/second_map.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					<b>Mapping the Land-Population Gap Across Metro Boston</b>
				<br/>
				To identify where this land-population imbalance is most extreme, this
				interactive map colors each municipality by the gap between its
				single-family land share and single-family population share, with red
				indicating municipalities where SF zones take far more land than the
				population they house. Hovering reveals stark cases like Milton, where
				98% of land is zoned single-family but only 15% of the population lives
				there. Conversely, municipalities like Lynn show the opposite: 100% of its
				population lives in the SF zone despite only 39% of land being zoned
				that way, resulting in a negative gap. The geographic pattern suggests
				that the imbalance is most pronounced in certain inner suburbs west
				and south of Boston, where single-family zoning holds large 
				land while other, non single-family population concentrates in the small area zoned
				for other housing.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				Through this analysis, I explored three questions about single-family
				zoning in Metro Boston, working within a dataset that required
				significant quality caveats, including unreliable raw population counts,
				within-dataset household discrepancies (between 2010 and 2014-2018), and geographic gaps that exclude
				some of the region's densest urban cores. Despite these limitations,
				comparing between zone types rather than across municipalities revealed
				consistent patterns. 1) Single-family zones do not house distinctly
				different families: family sizes, age distributions, and household
				structures are nearly identical across SF and Other zones, challenging
				the argument that single-family zoning exists to protect large families
				with children. 2) While household structure looks the same, the
				people are different: SF zones are slightly whiter and
				wealthier, with every nonwhite group
				and every lower-income bracket underrepresented, suggesting that
				single-family zoning might sort residents by race and income rather than
				by family need. 3) This comes at a spatial cost: 74% of
				residential land is reserved for single-family zones that house only 53%
				of the population, compressing everyone else into a fraction of the
				remaining space, a pattern most extreme in inner suburbs like Milton,
				where 98% of land serves just 15% of residents. Taken together, these
				findings suggest that single-family zoning in Metro Boston functions less
				as family protection and more as a mechanism that concentrates land,
				wealth, and racial homogeneity while crowding the remaining population
				into increasingly dense alternatives. HOWEVER, these conclusions should be
				interpreted with caution given the dataset's geographic gaps, which likely
				underrepresent the region's most diverse and dense communities, meaning
				the true extent of these disparities may be larger than what this
				analysis captures.
